# This script watches the disk given by user and when disk being greater than "90%" that I send mail to user.
#Â Well, before system crash, Admin will be aware that he/she should work to make disk available space on it.

# You can set this script to CRON to make this script works every minute, hour, day, etc.



# ------------IMPORTANT------------- #

# Please write the name of the disk which disk or partition has been mounted to ( "/" ).
# Use "df -h" command to see which disk mounted to ( "/" ) and then write disk name into the variable..

# For example, for me I will write "/dev/sda1" into the variable.
# EXAMPLE: Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
# EXAMPLE: /dev/sda1        20G  3.2G   15G  18% /

diskname="/dev/sda1"

# ------------IMPORTANT------------- #


# ***** Requirements! *****
# Install "Ssmtp" and configure it.

# Which mail that the warning message will be send when disk greater than 90%.

# Rest of the shell script commands.
